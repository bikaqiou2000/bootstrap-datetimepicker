## Datetimepicker for Bootstrap 3

Because we haven't found a datetimepicker which is actually working nicely with the newest bootstrap, we deceided to make tarruda's compatible.

The main changes:

* Working with bootstrap 3

* In this version, datetimepickers don't disappear by default, if their corresponding input was clicked. But you can specify an option to change this behavior. If you desire so, just add a "hideOnInputClick: true" to the datetimepicker's options.

* The bootstrap-dependency is now handled by bower (no more submodules).
